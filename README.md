This repository contains R code for LAB sections in the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" by James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T. and Tibshirani, R (2013)

I leave some comments for each line of the code so that this repository can be a standalone tutorial. 
However, I think this book is worth buying and I reccomend you to keep it handy.
Fortunately, the first edition of the book is freely available for download from the link below.

Most of the figures are drawn by using ggplot2. 
Note that some results are different from those in the textbook possibly due to R version.
