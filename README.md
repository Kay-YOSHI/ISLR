# ISLR

This repository contains R code for LAB sections in the book "*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*" written by James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T. and Tibshirani, R. (2013).

I leave some comments for each line of the code so that this repository can be a standalone tutorial on the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
However, I strongly reccomend you to keep the book handy for your deeper understanding because the concepts and intuitions behind each algorithms are detailed in the book.
Fortunately, the book is freely available for download from the link below.

If you are familiar with mathematics, I additionally recommend you the book "*The Elements of Statistical Learning*" written by Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R. and Friedman, J. (2009), which is mathematically rigorous and puts more focus on the mathematical aspects of each machine learning algorithm.
This book is also freely available for download from the link below.

Note that most of the figures are drawn by using ggplot2 and some results are different from those in the textbook possibly due to R version. 

The data files "Auto.txt" and "Auto.csv" are used in "ISLR_Ch2.R". 
In other R files, the data sets which are part of the base R package or package "ISLR" are utilized.
